AI-Powered Medical Diagnosis System

A project developed as part of the AICTE Internship - A Smart Solution for Early Disease Detection

Project Overview

The AI-Powered Medical Diagnosis System is an AI-driven healthcare assistant designed for early disease detection and prediction. Utilizing machine learning and medical image analysis, the system evaluates patient data to identify potential health conditions. This project serves as the foundation for an advanced AI-based diagnostic tool, with plans for additional features and accuracy enhancements.

Key Features

* **Automated Disease Prediction:** AI models analyze medical data to predict potential health risks.
* **Multiple Data Inputs:** Supports medical images (X-rays, MRIs, etc.) and structured health records.
* **Real-Time Analysis:** Provides fast and accurate diagnostic results based on patient data.
* **Visual Interpretation:** Highlights affected areas in medical scans for better understanding.
* **User-Friendly Web Interface:** Simple interface for uploading medical reports and viewing analysis results.
* **Powered by Deep Learning Models:** Ensures high accuracy and reliability in diagnostics.

Installation Guide

1. Clone the Repository
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/AI_Medical_Diagnosis-AICTE_Internship.git  
   cd AI_Medical_Diagnosis-AICTE_Internship  

2. Install Dependencies
