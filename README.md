# AI-Powered Medical Diagnosis System

A project developed as part of the AICTE Internship - A Smart Solution for Early Disease Detection

## Project Overview

The AI-Powered Medical Diagnosis System is an AI-driven healthcare assistant designed to help in the early detection and prediction of diseases. Using machine learning and medical image analysis, the system evaluates patient data to assist in identifying potential health conditions. This project serves as the foundation for a more advanced AI-based diagnostic tool, with plans to integrate additional features and enhance accuracy.

## Key Features

- **Automated Disease Prediction:** Uses AI models to analyze medical data and predict potential health risks.
- **Supports Multiple Data Inputs:** Works with medical images (X-rays, MRIs, etc.) and structured health records.
- **Real-Time Analysis:** Provides quick and accurate diagnostic results based on patient data.
- **Visual Interpretation:** Highlights affected areas in medical scans for better understanding.
- **User-Friendly Web Interface:** Easy-to-use interface for uploading medical reports and viewing analysis results.
- **Powered by Deep Learning Models:** Ensures high accuracy and reliability in medical diagnostics.

## Installation Guide

### 1. Clone the Repository
Use the following commands to clone the repository and navigate to the project directory:

```
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/AI_Medical_Diagnosis-AICTE_Internship.git
cd AI_Medical_Diagnosis-AICTE_Internship
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```

## How It Works

1. **Select Input:**
   - Choose between **Upload Medical Image** or **Enter Patient Data** in the application interface.

2. **For Image-Based Diagnosis:**
   - Click on **Upload Medical Image** and select an X-ray, MRI, or CT scan for analysis.

3. **For Data-Based Diagnosis:**
   - Click on **Enter Patient Data** and fill in symptoms, age, medical history, etc.

4. **Get Results:**
   - Disease Predictions based on AI model analysis.
   - Highlighted affected regions in the uploaded medical scans.
   - Suggestions for further medical consultation.

## Technology Used
